# Caesar-Cipher---Frontend-Backend-Project

Hello dear viewer, 

Welcome to my Caesar Cipher Project Remastered. 

Q&A

1. Why remastered? : This project helps me few months ago to experience C# coding and I decide to update it to something visual too.
2. Will be updated? : Of course, every time I'm coming back to my previous project, they are a part of my journey in programming.
3. Can I have access to project ? : As source code, for sure, but I don't have a domain yet to exploit it on a website. New updates soon.

The project contains 2 versions : code only (C#) and Frontend version (JS-HTML-CSS). Thank you ! See you soon ^_^
